# ajax-tester

A simple tool for testing AJAX calls. The GUI is self explanatory enough.
Usage: 
1. Start server & make AJAX calls from javascript. Data will be shown in the textbox.
2. Fill in AJAX data and send the request. Your backend app will receive the data.

The client (sending AJAX request) and AJAX response server should ideally be two separate applications, but I combined them for ease of use.
